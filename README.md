# predict-Sine-by-using-RNN
This is a simple RNN to predict time series data (sine). It shows a dynamic way of trying with different activators and optimizers.

* Time series data analysis is a popular data analysis area. The ability to predict along the time series is one of the main goals of analyzing time series data.

* Recurrent neruo network is an advanced algorithm to analyze time series data. 

* Here is a simple long-short term memory recurrent neruo network that is built with tflearn on top of tensorflow. 

* It is dynamic and can be applied to similar situations, such as sales prediction.
