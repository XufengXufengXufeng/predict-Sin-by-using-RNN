# predict-Sin-by-using-RNN
use a simple RNN to predict time series data (sin). Show a dynamic way of trying with different activators and optimizers.

* time series data is widely used in data analysis. The ability to predict along the time series is one of the main goals of analyzing time series data.

* Recurrent neruo network is one of the most advanced algorithm to analyze time series data. 

* Here is a simple long-short term memory recurrent neruo network is built using tflearn on top of tensorflow to predict sin. 

* it is dynamic and can be applied to similar situations, such as sales predict, with little changes.
